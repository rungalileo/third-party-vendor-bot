# Third-Party Vendor Onboarding Bot

A comprehensive demo showcasing AI agent monitoring and observability in a real-world vendor onboarding scenario. Built with LangGraph and Streamlit, this application demonstrates how to monitor complex AI workflows with RAG capabilities using Galileo's observability platform. In the Galileo project, you will see the demonstration of business metrics such as Third Party Vendor Risk based on the session.

## Demo Highlights

- ü§ñ **Multi-Step AI Workflow**: LangGraph-powered agent with structured vendor onboarding process
- üìä **Complete Observability**: Full conversation and tool usage monitoring with Galileo
- üè¢ **RAG Integration**: Vector database search with Pinecone for company risk assessment
- üìã **Progress Visualization**: Real-time tracking of multi-step application workflows
- üí¨ **Interactive Interface**: Production-ready Streamlit chat interface
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Tool Usage**: Demonstrates tool calling patterns and state management

## Architecture Overview

This demo showcases a production-ready AI agent architecture with:

### Custom Tools
1. **lookup_company_information**: Demonstrates RAG search with Pinecone vector database
2. **save_compliance_certifications**: Shows structured data collection and validation  
3. **save_data_access_requirements**: Captures and processes vendor requirements
4. **get_onboarding_summary**: Provides session state summarization

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Complete trace visibility** of multi-step agent workflows
- **Tool usage analytics** showing RAG search patterns and data collection
- **Session tracking** across complex onboarding processes
- **Performance metrics** for response times and completion rates

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd third-party-vendor-bot
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables
Copy the example environment file and add your API keys:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GALILEO_API_KEY=your_galileo_api_key_here
GALILEO_PROJECT=your_galileo_project_here
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=your_galileo_log_stream_here
GALILEO_CONSOLE_URL=your_galileo_console_url_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name_here
```
* To connect to streamlit, you will need to set values in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/connections/secrets.toml

### 5. Set up the company database
Before running the application, you need to set up the Pinecone vector database with company information:

```bash
cd scripts
python setup_pinecone.py
```

This will load the company directory documents into Pinecone for RAG search functionality.

### 6. Run the application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Running the Demo

### For Demo Audiences
1. **Launch Application**: Start with the vendor onboarding assistant's welcome message
2. **Showcase Workflow**: Use example companies to demonstrate the structured 3-step process
3. **Highlight Monitoring**: Show real-time progress tracking and session management
4. **Demonstrate RAG**: Watch company database searches in action
5. **Review Analytics**: Check Galileo dashboard for complete workflow visibility

### Demo Flow Examples
**Company Lookup Demo:**
- "Tech Solutions Inc, incorporated in the United States"
- "Shadow Tech Enterprises, incorporated in the United States"

**Compliance Collection Demo:**
- "We have SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance certifications"

**Data Access Demo:**
- "We need access to customer contact information and billing data for our CRM integration"

Each step demonstrates different aspects of agent workflow monitoring and tool usage analytics.

## Observability with Galileo

This demo showcases comprehensive AI agent monitoring capabilities through [Galileo's observability platform](https://v2docs.galileo.ai/sdk-api/third-party-integrations/openai-agents/openai-agents):

### What You'll See in Galileo
- **Complete conversation flows** with step-by-step agent decision making
- **Tool usage patterns** showing RAG searches, data validation, and state updates
- **Multi-turn conversation tracking** across complex vendor onboarding sessions
- **Performance analytics** including response times, token usage, and completion rates
- **Error tracking and debugging** for failed tool calls or workflow issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (required)
- Pinecone API key (required for company database)
- Galileo API key and project configuration (optional for monitoring)
